README: 3-2-1 Countdown

To use the 3-2-1 Countdown: 

1.  Add the Countdown321 prefab to the Objects panel under an orthographic 
    camera. Make sure the Number object's layer is set to a layer rendered 
    by the orthographic camera.

2.  Adjust countdown parameters in the Inspector panel. Note: Start and end 
    color include opacity to make the countdown fade in or out.

3.  Check off Use Behavior to trigger a Behavior script response on
    countdown completion and / or check off Script With API and edit the 
    OnComplete script.

4.  Set the countdown to Play On Start in the Inspector panel, or uncheck the 
    box and trigger the countdown to start using the Script component or 
    global function (refer to the CountdownController script comments).
